# jni: Bindings to the Java Native Interface (JNI)

This package provides somewhat low-level, unopinionated bindings
to the [Java Native Interface (JNI)](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jni/).

For most JVM interaction needs, *inline-java* should be enough but
if you find something missing or if you want to offer an alternative
high-level API to the JNI, you are in the right place.
